## 📝 Description

Spice up your classic OpenRCT2 scenarios with the research-randomizer plugin! This plugin introduces an element of surprise by randomizing the research progression and starting technologies, offering a fresh and unpredictable assortment of rides and stalls each time you play. Rediscover old favorites and adapt your park strategy to the ever-changing availability of attractions.

## ⚙️ Using the plugin

You must do a one-time scan of your OpenRCT rides using the Smart Scan button (and do it again if you install new content), then just pick how many total technologies you want available over the course of the game (anywhere from 1x, which is unchanged from the default numbers, up to 3x, which triples the total list of technolgies you can unlock unless you run out of new rides to research!) and select if you want to be guaranteed to start with the Cash Machine or Info Kiosk unlocked.

Then just click the "Randomize Research" button to shuffle things up!

Anything already built in the park will be guaranteed to stay researched, but everything else is fair game to be shuffled.

Feel free to hit the button multiple times if you're unhappy with the first spin of the wheel.
